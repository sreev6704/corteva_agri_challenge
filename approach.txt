1. Modeling of Data:
    - Created three Models 
    - Weather (to store the weather data)
    - Yield (to store the yield data)
    - WeatherStats (to store the weather statistics data)

2. Data Ingestion:
    - created src/corteva_agri/assignment/ingest.py.
    - ingest.py contains ingest_weather_data() & ingest_yield_data. 
    - ingest_weather_data() to read the weather data and save in Weather Model.
    - ingest_yield_data() to read the yield data and save in Yield Model.

3. Data Analysis:
    - generate_statistics_data() function calculates 
      the average maximum temperature, average minimum temperature, total accumulated
      precipitation for every year, for every weather station.
      (constraints applied)
    - all the analysed data stored in the WeatherStats Model.
    
4. Rest APIâ€™s task :
    - Created three REST API's
    - (api/weather) - fetches all the weather data.
    - (api/yield) - fetches all the yield data.
    - (api/weather/stats) - fetches all the analysed data.

-All the logs will be stored in answers/output.log.
-Pagination & filtering in API has implemented.
